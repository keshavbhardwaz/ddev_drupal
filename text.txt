Initiate the git in the local folder/directory


git init  						
git remote add origin <git link>                        origin is the referring name for git link
git remote -v 				                                  to verify remote location 


Git pull <git link> <branch>


——-Adding, Committing and Pushing ——-
git add file_name or git add . 		                	   to add all the file
git commit -m “commit message in present tense”

git push origin branch_name
git push origin main 
Or
git push -u origin main 			                     		to set origin main as upstream




Branch:

Git branch 								    	                  	to check branch
Git branch -M main 						    	                rename the branch from master to main
Git branch -d branch_name				             	      to delete any branch
Git checkout -b branch_name				                  creating branch
Git checkout new_branch_name			            	    checkout to other branch
Git checkout branch_name^				              	    Head move to parent of branch_name

Git log
Git logs hash id
Git show
Git blame file_name


———————————Merging:———————————
Merging in Git creates a special commit that has two unique parents. A commit with two parents essentially means "I want to include all the work from this parent over here and this one over here, and the set of all their parents."


Git diff
Git merge origin branch_name


——————————-Reverting———————————-

Git reset —hard git_id
Git revert ~1
Git revert git_id(hash_id)

Difference between git revert and reset?
What is rebase in git and where it is used?

Detaching HEAD
Detaching HEAD just means attaching it to a commit instead of a branch



You can directly reassign a branch to a commit with the -f option. So something like:
git branch -f main HEAD~3
moves (by force) the main branch to three parents behind HEAD.
Note: In a real git environment git branch -f command is not allowed for your current branch.



What is git checkout HEAD~1? Why we can not use git branch -f HEAD~1? Explain command and its use: git branch -f bugfix HEAD~1?

Q: What would you do if you urgently needed information from someone working in a drastically different timezone (who was almost certainly asleep)? (They asked me this a few different times in slightly different ways.)

Q: Hello support! My business has an internal Git server used for deployments. We have an internal Git server and we also use GitHub. For workflow purposes, how do I sync my repository to GitHub and and the internal Git server?
